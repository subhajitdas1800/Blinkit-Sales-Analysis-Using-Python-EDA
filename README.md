# Blinkit Sales Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkit sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis focuses on identifying key patterns that can help improve decision-making related to inventory management, customer demand, and overall sales performance.

The project is designed to present insights in a simple, business-friendly manner, making it easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand the results.

## Business Requirement
KPI Requirements
- Total Sales:
- Average Sales:
- Number of Items Sold:
- Average Customer Rating:

Chart Requirements
- Total Sales by Fat Content
- Total Sales by Item Type
- Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year

# Insights
- Item Type Performance: Sales are concentrated in a limited number of item categories, showing that a few high-demand products drive most of the revenue while many items contribute marginally.
- Fat Content Preference: Low Fat products generate higher total sales compared to Regular items, indicating a clear customer preference toward healthier options.

- Outlet-wise Fat Content Sales: Across most outlets, Low Fat items consistently outperform Regular items, suggesting that product mix plays an important role in outlet-level performance.

- Outlet Establishment Impact: Older outlets tend to generate higher total sales, which indicates that outlet maturity and customer trust contribute positively to revenue.

- Outlet Size Effect: Medium-sized outlets record the highest sales, showing an optimal balance between inventory variety and operational efficiency.

- Outlet Location Trend: Tier 3 locations contribute the highest sales among all locations, highlighting strong demand in non-metro or semi-urban areas.
